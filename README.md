## why smurfes
When deciding on the theme I wanted for the game, I chose the Smurfs for a couple of reasons.

- I'm from Belgium, where the Smurfs originated. We have comics and a cartoons about them here. They're really iconic here.
- Because they were created for comics, their characters are designed to be silly and funny.
- There are lots of characters, so I could include a variety of them charecters. (But they are mostly blue.)

However, as they aren't very well known internationally, most of their names don't have English translations. So all their names are in Dutch.
